## Introduction

Food item recognition is a significant task in various applications such as dietary assessment, restaurant automation, and food logging. This project aims to classify different food items using a deep learning model trained on a comprehensive dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. You can download it from the following link:

https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101
After downloading the dataset, upload the images to the Google Colab environment. 
## Preprocessing
Before training the model, the data needs to be preprocessed. This includes:

- Resizing images to a consistent size
- Normalizing pixel values
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- Data augmentation (if necessary)

## Training
The deep learning model is trained using the preprocessed images. The training process is implemented in the train.py file. Key steps include:

- Loading and preprocessing the dataset
- Defining the model architecture (e.g., Convolutional Neural Network)
- Compiling the model with appropriate loss function and optimizer
- Training the model
- Saving the trained model
